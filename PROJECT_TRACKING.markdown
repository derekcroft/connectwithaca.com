Markus' Progress and Planning Tracker for ACA Work
==================================================

To-Do List
--------------------------------------
In planned-implementation order

+   Edit Profile: Add support for entering projects

+   Profile: Track down the missing image which is logging errors

+   Edit Profile: Clean up my implementation of Expertise editing.

    Either use nested attributes or at least do error checking on ProfileExpertise save.

+   Clean up the UI for the Show view.

    As part of this, find the sources of how it looked previously.

+   Figure out why the schema.rb file on master was different than the one generated by running rake db:migrate.


Open Questions
----------------------

+   How should the Show Profile view differ from the Edit view?
